# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Prediction

**Singapore Resale Flat Price Prediction Web Application**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The predictive model is based on historical data of resale flat transactions, assisting potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

**Motivation**

The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, making it challenging to accurately estimate the resale value of a flat. Factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration can significantly impact resale prices. This project aims to overcome these challenges by providing users with an estimated resale price based on these factors.

**Scope**

The project involves the following tasks:
1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to Till Date. Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.
2.	Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset and create additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
3.	Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression and train it on the historical data.
4.	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's predictive performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score.
5.	Streamlit Web Application: Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to input details of a flat and predict the resale price based on user inputs.
6.	Deployment on Render: Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it accessible to users over the internet.
7.	Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.

**Results**

This project benefits potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market by providing them with an estimation of resale prices, enabling informed decisions. It also demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in real estate and web development.

**Usage**

1.	Clone this repository.
2.	Install required Python libraries.
3.	Run the Streamlit application using the command streamlit run app.py.
4.	Input details of the flat in the web application to get the predicted resale price.
